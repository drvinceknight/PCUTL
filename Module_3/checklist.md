# Module 3 portfolio

The focus of this portfolio (20 credit so slightly larger than past ones): module/curriculum design and assessment/feedback.

## ILO 2:

- effectivce
- facilitate
- achievement
- appropriate
- range of learners

Use critique of an existing module or if you run a new module "that's fantastic".

Don't forgot module 1!!! How does this module fit in the bigger picture. Go back to those journals. Look at subject benchmark stuff and welsh government policy.

Don't have "Cardiff strategic plan" anymore, have "Cardiff, the way forward". This is relevant to placing module in the **new cardiff**.

Re ILO 5, raise questions to think about re new structure in university. (Maybe think of these re Module 4).

Think of level descriptors, talk about ILOs of class. Talk about Bloom. Critique ILOs of module against Bloom, Biggs etc...

Also talk about pedagogic theory (not specifically asked in ILOs but it's good to talk about it). **Go ahead of what is asked.**

ILO 2: 'Trying to stand back and explain conscious decisions.'

Can mention student numbers... Talk about some boundaries and issues.

## ILO 3:

How valid, reliable and 'something else' our assessment is ('in the literature there is a whole range of ways things can be assessed but pragmatically...')

Talk about assessment of computing exams.

**Include some examples of real feedback** relate to Cardiff feedback policy (find that).

Can be critical of the feedback.

Ok to mix and match certain modules (but need to clarify how it all fits in).

**25th of October deadline**
