	abstract = {As student-centered approaches to teaching and learning are more widely applied, researchers must assess the outcomes of these interventions across a range of courses and institutions. As an example of such assessment, this study examined the impact of inquiry-based learning ({IBL)} in college mathematics on undergraduates’ subsequent grades and course selection at two institutions. Insight is gained upon disaggregating results by course type ({IBL} vs. non-{IBL)}, by gender, and by prior mathematics achievement level. In particular, the impact of {IBL} on previously low-achieving students’ grades is sizable and persistent. The authors offer some methodological advice to guide future such studies.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews representative research into blended learning in universities, taking into account the methodology used, the focus of the research and the relationship between the two. In terms of methodology, most research was classifiable as case-studies, survey-based studies or comparative studies. A small number of studies take a comparatively more holistic approach and one of the outcomes from this review is a recommendation for more holistic studies to be undertaken. In the studies reviewed, the focus of the research is often related to the degree of methodological complexity. That is, less methodologically elaborated studies tend to have a more specific focus, while the studies employing a more complex methodology tend to report more varied aspects of the students' learning experience. It is argued that educationally useful research on blended learning needs to focus on the relationships between different modes of learning (for example, face-to-face and on-line) and especially on the nature of their integration. In particular, such research needs to generate usable evidence about the quality of the students' learning experiences and learning outcomes. In turn, this demands appropriately powerful methodologies, rooted in a firm theoretical foundation.},

	abstract = {Reports on the evaluation of an innovative approach to teaching entrepreneurship. The authors approached the design of an entrepreneurship course on the premise that the instruction should be appeal to, and reflect, the unique personality characteristics of the entrepreneur student, in order to produce a more effective course.         Based on personality tests of 401 Baylor University students, a personality profile of the entrepreneurship student was developed. The students tend to be more autonomous, self-reliant, self-determined, rebellious, flexible, unpredictable, and unmanageable; they welcome change and new experiences. To appeal to and encourage these traits, the senior-level entrepreneurship course was designed to be unstructured, pose problems, require novel solutions under conditions of ambiguity and risk, stress independent study, and include a "frustration factor."        The authors devised an evaluation tool, administered near the end of the semester, to assess the students' experience and whether course objectives were met. Found that most of the students: perceived the course as new and different and probably appreciated this fact; perceived the course's uncertain outcomes and enjoyed this ambiguity; felt the class taught them to deal with real-world ambiguity; believed the course was unstructured and preferred this format; had opportunity to exercise individual capability and liked this approach; enjoyed the opportunity the to exercise social adroitness and persuasion; enjoyed learning by doing; had their self-confidence enhanced; and perceived the course as relevant and enhancing their understanding of business.

Consequently, there is a need to incorporate alternative methods of assessment that are able to effectively assess the range of students’ mathematical abilities. The present study investigated methods of assessment used by 60 mathematics teachers from 11 secondary schools in metropolitan Sydney, as well as their attitudes to a range of alternative assessment methods, together with reasons why they would or would not implement these. Results showed that teachers were satisfied with traditional tests as valid measures of student ability, particularly for senior school years. Teachers generally did not favour implementing alternative assessment methods, although those with the least years’ teaching experience reported more positive attitudes. A major concern raised by teachers about the use of alternative assessment methods related to their perceived subjectivity. Explanations for these findings are advanced for teachers who have varying lengths of teaching experience.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the harmonizing role of technology and interaction in a qualitative study on blended problem-based learning within the context of academic development in higher education. Within this setting, and as both designers and tutors in blended {PBL}, it is important to seek best practices for how to combine instructional strategies in face-to-face and computer-mediated environments that take advantage of the strengths of each and avoid their weaknesses. A qualitative study of the lived experiences of 17 academic staff participants in a blended problem-based learning module was considered likely to provide a much-needed analysis of current thinking and practice on the potential of interaction in this form of professional academic development in higher education. Specific aspects of interaction (technical, peer, content and the learning experience) within blended problem-based learning tutorials are analysed to provides research-based information about the realities of delivering a {PBL} programme using technology. The study argues that the intersection of {PBL} and learning technologies can offer different ways of teaching and learning that require exploration and reflection of pedagogy and technology as in integrated approach that must work effectively together. The synergy from the collaborative blended {PBL} approach in this module could result in the coherent and comprehensive provision of training, support and research work throughout higher education institutions.},

The way we traditionally design college classes -- with lecture front and center in class and homework outside of class -- suffers from two serious flaws: There is no natural way to find and repair student misconceptions by the end of class, and students' access to expert help is inversely proportional to their need for help. The inverted or "flipped" classroom is a solution to those design flaws. In this presentation we discuss flipped course design, best practices for designing a flipped lesson, and lessons learned from flipping.},

	abstract = {Teaching (and therefore learning) {eXtreme} Programming ({XP)} in a university setting is difficult because of course time limitations and the soft nature of {XP} that requires first-hand experience in order to see and really learn the methods. For example, iterations are either shorter or fewer than appropriate. In this paper we present the properties to tune when designing an {eXtreme} Programming course. These are the properties we gathered by conducting three {XP} labs as part of our software engineering teaching. Within this paper we describe our set-up as well as the important properties. Lecturers and teachers can use this property system and combine it with their own constraints in order to derive a better {XP} lab for their curriculum.},

	abstract = {In this article, the actual impact on students' instructional and epistemological beliefs of systematic attempts to implement a problem‐based, collaborative and technologically‐rich learning environment in regular, internationally‐spread, secondary school classrooms is described. Although the literature suggests that learning environments do affect both categories of beliefs, empirical evidence is currently limited. To study the effects of learning environments, classroom‐based learning environments were redesigned in various respects. The change entailed the implementation of a problem‐based, collaborative and technologically‐rich environment to replace the more regular content‐driven, teacher‐centred and textbook‐based environment. The implementation of the innovation was hypothesised to result in a change of both the instructional and epistemological beliefs of students. Moreover, these beliefs were expected to evolve in the direction of the assumptions underlying the innovative environment. A classical pretest and posttest study resulted in the confirmation of the first hypothesis. However, for the second hypothesis, the opposite was found: students' beliefs strengthened in a direction that contradicts the basic principles underlying the designed environment. The study highlights that a poor implementation of potentially powerful learning environments can result in unexpected and even undesirable side effects.},

Finally, administrative and leadership issues are addressed and the outline of an action plan to implement blended learning approaches is presented. The conclusion is that blended learning is consistent with the values of traditional higher education institutions and has the proven potential to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of meaningful learning experiences.},

However, there is currently little research about how predominately campus-based students' experiences of the on-line part of their course are associated with their experience of the course as a whole.

In 2003, the American Society for Training and Development identified blended learning as one of the top ten trends to emerge in the knowledge delivery industry (cited by Rooney, 2003). In 2002, The Chronicle of Higher Education quoted the president of Pennsylvania State University as saying that the convergence between online and residential instruction was â? the single-greatest unrecognized trend in higher education today â? (Young, 2002, p. A33). Also quoted in that article was the editor of The Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks who predicted a dramatic increase in the number of hybrid (i.e., blended) courses in higher education, possibly to include as many as 80-90 \% of all courses (Young, 2002). So what is this â? blended learning â? that everyone is talking about? This chapter will provide a basic introduction to blended learning systems and share some trends and issues that are highly relevant to those who are implementing such systems. To accomplish these goals, the chapter will address five important questions related to blended learning systems such as: What is blended learning?, Why blend?, What current},

While this is the promise of higher education, a substantial body of research indicates that cognitive growth remains elusive for most universities and for most disciplines, including engineering. In this paper, we discuss a framework for facilitating open ended problem solving through the use of an inverted classroom. A basic premise of the inverted classroom model is that richer open-ended problem solving experiences can be conducted within the classroom environment. Required readings and preparatory work through online interactive materials provide one opportunity for intellectual diversity and allow lectures to be replaced with more engaged pedagogies that require problems to be viewed from multiple perspectives. An example format and preliminary data for a course in cost estimating is presented.},

	abstract = {The organisation of students into groups (or communities) for learning purposes is an established pedagogic method in higher education. Teachers are now using group methods in networked e‐learning contexts, albeit without a full understanding of the dynamics of group work in these settings. This is a new and evolving arena in higher education. In this article, the learning dynamics of three collaborative, networked e‐learning groups are examined in an attempt to understand how students work in them. A detailed ethnography indicates that two of the groups worked harmoniously, and successfully produced a collective end product. The other group exhibited extreme anxiety and division, and required extra resources from its members in order to sustain itself and produce its collective end product. Anxiety became a major focus for this group, which had the effect of diverting it from effective collective production. The ethnography shows that the place of identity, control, ontological security and guilt in collaborative e‐learning groups can be central to the effective work of the groups. The difference between the groups with respect to these categories is used as a point of departure in order to show how an understanding of the dynamics of networked learning groups and communities may be of benefit to teachers and students working in these new environments.},

	abstract = {Recent technological developments have given rise to blended learning classrooms. An inverted (or flipped) classroom is a specific type of blended learning design that uses technology to move lectures outside the classroom and uses learning activities to move practice with concepts inside the classroom. This article compares the learning environments of an inverted introductory statistics class with a traditional introductory statistics class at the same university. This mixed-methods research study used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory ({CUCEI)}, field notes, interviews and focus groups to investigate the learning environments of these two classrooms. Students in the inverted classroom were less satisfied with how the classroom structure oriented them to the learning tasks in the course, but they became more open to cooperative learning and innovative teaching methods. These findings are discussed in terms of how they contribute to the stability and connectedness of classroom learning communities.},

It is the result of a two and a half years' experience with peer assessment in classes of different combinations of size, entry qualifications and experience. Initially, the methods devised by Goldfinch \& Raeside (1990) were used; the relevance and drawbacks of this two‐part method of assessment in the field of civil engineering are discussed and new ideas are proposed. That article had suggested that the model is transferable. It has proved to be the case and in this discipline, that project diaries which the tutor uses to allocate individuals a mark, offer a unique alternative to Part 1 of the assessment process.},
