# MA1003 Computing for Mathematics
## Project proposal guidance

In week 3 you are required to write a short project proposal for your group. The aim of this proposal is to:

- Indicate what problem/opportunity you plan on tackling;
- Show that as a group you have carried out some research on the topic;
- Describe your approach to solving the problem/opportunity.

## Strategy (half a page)

In this section aim to answer the following question:

> "What problem and/or opportunity are we going to tackle?"

Be sure to consider the following points:

- What would be your strategy for your product to be used? (eg 'Building a program that identifies the location of the Mars Rover')
- How will your product be useful, who is it for?  (eg 'The product will be used by NASA')
- What is the greater potential for your product? (eg 'If successful our product could be used by ongoing commercial Mars landing projects')

## Market research

In this section you need to show that you have carried out some exploratory research to answer the following question:

> "What has already been done and what do we need to know to build our product?"

Be sure to consider the current state of the art (even if you are perhaps not quite capable of understanding it at this early point in your mathematical careers). Also, consider some of the tools you might need to learn (eg a new python library perhaps). You are expected to use the skills taught to you by the Cardiff University library team.


## Product definition (half a page)

In this section you need to explain what exactly it is that you are going to try to do:

> "How are we going to tackle this problem/opportunity?"

This section could include a process diagram but might also importantly need some high level pseudo code.

**Good Luck!**
