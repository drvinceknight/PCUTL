# Design for learning

This module has a group project and we have 6 months to complete.

Group project is supposedly meant to be a small piece of work looking at something that made us go "Hey that is interesting".

Programme for today:

- 0930 Design for development - Biggs and Bloom
- 1030 Coffee
- 1045 Influences on module and programme design
- 1245 Lunch
- 1400 Influence on module and programme design
- 1430 Planning a programme
- 1500 Tea
- 1515 Designing and teaching a module
- 1630 Departure

Two handouts:

- Biggs : observered learning outcomes
- Bloom: six cognitive levels of complexity in behaviour

We will now compare and contrast these two models.

Our group came up with:

- Bloom is a model of comprehension
- Biggs is a model of evaluation

So when evaluating can you evaluate comprehension? We also reckon that one can map to the other.

So ILOs correspond to Biggs and through them you're trying to get to Bloom?

Now the whole class are discussing. Saying that Bloom is restrictive in it's direction. Are we just learning facts? I mentioned flipping Bloom's pyramind in an IBL way.

Mention of work by Thomas Lund: analysis of last exam questions from last 10 years in his department.

General consensus is that Biggs isn't great (hasn't added much). But bloom can/(should?) be flipped

# Moving on to something else

Stepping away from Biggs and Bloom. Debate with us on the influences of tools that we will all be using when we design our modules and programmes.

## National and local credit frameworks

- Note the level of your module: year
- In broad terms, what do you think should be the qualities, abilities ad characteristics of a student finishing that year of their course.
    - Certificate year (first year)
    - Intermediate year/diploma year (second year)
    - Degree year (third year)

You can theoretically get a certificate of higher ed at any point.

As an example I'm writing mine for MAT013:

    - MSc course (4th year)
    - Qualities, abilities and characteristics:
        - Self learn (qualities)
        - Technical knowledge of programming languages (abilities)
        - Presentation (abilities)

We have been handed the Welsh framework which gives the nationally accepted frameworks for various levels (level 4 is year 1).

We had a long conversation about worth of one degree in different universities (Oxford v Oxford Brooks).

Pragmatically we are looking at minimum standards.

**Academics often talk about critical analysis**

Asked to describe how we would recognize good critical analysis in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd year and msc students.

1. Knowledge of subject
2. Ability to prove results
3. Knowledge of some literature
4. Knowledge of modern literature on subject, capacity to apply, prove and present.

**Subject benchmark standards**

We've been handed the subject benchmarks for business.

**Skills for employability**

Discussion about including employability skills in programme.

**Student feedback, evaluation and research**

I use:

- Student feedback forms (official and my own) for a module as well as informal discussion and exam results;

- Forms
- Conversations
- Guy has mentioned using google docs. The workshop coordinator doesn't realise that this is equivalent to forms and he's ridiculously impressed. Having said that this can be done continuously throughout the class which is good.
- Mid module feedback

That's for a module but for programme?

- Conversations with students during open days
- External examiner
- NSS
- staff student panel
- external certification (medecine and law)
- admissions figure
- employability
- external examination of other courses


*Module evaluations are not programme evaluations.*

Discussion about coherence of modules.

How do you make sure that assessments for your module are doing what they are supposed to do?
How do you make sure that assessments for your programme are doing what they are supposed to do?

We've been handed a programme evaluation questionnaire "the only 1 he has seen".

This is quite possibly the worst PCUTL workshop I've been on so far. I have no idea what the point is so far.

Talking to use about TESTA which is important apparently. [www.testa.ac.uk](www.testa.ac.uk). They are trying to analyse ways to analyse the assessment of a programme.

To ensure programme alignment make sure that everyone wants to do this.

*Influences on module and programme design*

Markets:

- information
- student satisfaction
- cost


We are now all moaning about fees. Lol.
We are now talking about MOOCS, what are degrees for etc...

*We are now talking about planning a programme.*

Here's the approach:

1. Considering your programme aims

    1. What do you think should be the broad, general aims of the programme?
    2. What do you think your colleagues in the Department think should be the broad, general aims of the programme? Is everyone agreed, or are there divergent views?
    3. When you discuss the programme with employers or pro bodies what do they think should be its broad general aims?
    4. When you discuss the programme with past graduates, what do they think should be the broad general aims?
    5. When you discuss the programme with your current students, what do they think should be its broad, general aims? Do they significantly differ from what you and your colleagues are offering?
    6. When you discuss the programme with colleagues in departments in other universitires what do they think should be the broad, general aims of such programmes?
    7. What do you think should be any distinguishing characteristics of the broad, general aims of the programme which might arise form it being offered by this particular university?

2. Considering your programme outcomes

From the broad general aims draw out the major intended outcomes of the programme.

What should a successful student know and be able to do as a result of having studied this programme?

It may help to use this classification:

- Knowledge
- Subject specific skills
- Generic skills
- Personal attributes
- Personal values

3. Setting your programme in context

Are you comfortable that the programme outcomes are congruent with the National Qualifications Framework?

Are you comfortable that the programme outcomes are either congruent with or can successfully challenge the benchmark statement for this subject?

Are you comfortable that you will have sufficient resources (staff, space, equipment, funds) to deliver the programme for at least five years?

4. Considering your programme assessment

How might a student be able to show the evidence that they have achieved the major intended outcomes of the programme?

What should be the major features of assessment across the whole programme?

5. Designing the programme using units or modules

Name and describe the modules which will makes up the programme ensuring that each module contribute to the assessment design and intended outcomes of the programme.

Has everything been covered?

Is anything unnecessarily repeated?

We now moved on to module prep but that was a brief re brief of what we've seen before many times.
