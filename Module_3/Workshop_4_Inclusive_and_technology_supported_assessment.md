# Inclusive and technology supported assessment

Aim of today is to `get what today is about`. Aim of tomorrow is to `work on projects` which sucks cause I'm not around...

Doing a `low tech wiki`...

Obliged to make reasonable adjustments... Must ensure that we describe what Module expectations are...

A discussion about making reasonable adjustments for parts of a course that are not **core** to the course.

We've been given a bunch of module descriptions and talked about what was wrong with them. In particular discussing what is a **competence standard** (see handouts).

Don't really know what the point of that exercise was...

# We now are looking at a case study from EARTH

Not sure what is going on...

Really interesting case study about a girl on crutches who was a geology student.

Field work was an issue.

Pete Burnap: "You can be in the field without being in the field..."

# From theory/policy to practice: pulling the strands together... and reprise

Talking about ILO 2 + 3

## ILO 2

- Curriculum design;
- Keywords: quality, effective, facilitate, range of learners;
- Subject benchmark standards;
- Competence standards;
- Level descriptors;
- Inclusivity;

## ILO 3

- Can be done at a superficial level;
- Take in to account the CU strategy which might conflict with our personal views;
- We are expected to place this ILO in our discipline but also in a wider context;

**Decoding and planning relevant to us:**

Stuff that might want to go in to portfolio:

- Curriculum model 1: Product (what is our role within the design process); which model of curriculum design are we choosing to use?
    i. We looked at something called Alexander's framework
    ii. Bubbly thing: looked at in Module 1, different accrediting bodies etc.. (HEFCW, Cardiff strategic plans, colleges etc...)
    iii. Vocational, mastery/induction, developmental/constructive, academic: our we teaching for teachings sake, or teaching a competence course or... (I can talk about all this with regards to my first year module). `WHAT IS AN EDUCATED PERSON IN OUR SETTING`. `Is a Methamatician a programmer?` (go to subject benchmarks and critique it... discuss death of 4 color theorem dude as an example...)

Module design questionnaire (Phil Race, December, 2007)

- What is the purpose? **QAA SBIs +/- Prof docs**
- Where it sits in the bigger picture?
- Where best placed? **Level desciptors**

Looking at Biggs constructive alignment:

- Intended Learning Outcomes: Inclusive, a clear statement of what the learner should be able to do on completing the module? Bloom. Kolb. Etc...

In portfolio, include the ILOs of a module and match them to Bloom, Kolb etc...

In portfolio discuss **assessement**, find examples in the **literature** and justify assessment. Also, mention **scalability**.

Consider contact and non-contact time.

Important to think about my own role in higher education. Aligned with philosophy of education.

Important point made about fact that we are caught up in systems that make things worse for the students...

We are being asked to critically engage with things...

Need to talk about contact and non contact time...

- **Have confidence in your understanding of the pedagogic ideas**
- **Hang on to your students' eye view**
- **Keep alert, challenge, discuss**
- **Collect ideas**

Talking about what we need to hand in:

- PCUTL peer PRLT
- PCUTL mentor PRLT (for both of these include resources, so what and next steps), with mentor link to assessement adn design. I think Paul and I will review my preparation for the python module...
- Group project (to include some e-technology)
- example of real feedback / feedforward (1 of the peer reviews could have feedback as a focus, feedback can be given to other PCUTLer peers).
- response to feedback
- mapping of learning against the UKPSF: lots of tick!
- 2000 word essay
