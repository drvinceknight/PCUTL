# Assessment and feedback for learning
_Nice to get a Math teacher to do this workshop..._

Assessment sends a message to students about what they sign up for.

Certain elements of what we do have to take account of scale.

**This module is about course design and assessement.**

Brown, G et al 1997: `If you want to change student learning then change the methods of assessment.`

## Issues in Assessment

### Issue of validity and authenticity

Assessment is valid if it indeed measures the things that it claims to be measuring.

**Constructive alignment**??

> "The fundamental principle of constructive alignment is that a good teaching system aligns teaching method and assessment to the learning activities stated in the objectives so that all aspects of this system are in accord in supporting appropriate student learning."

(Biggs)

An assessment is **reliable** if given the same kind of inputs you get the same kind of outputs.

MCQ tests can be made very reliable.

A further notion is that of `inter marker reliability`: if the test is reliable then the students' mark does not depend on the marker.

See studies by Laming (1990) and Newstead and Dennis (1994).

He shows us a book: Assessment literacy. They look at assessment communities of practice. (**Have bought kindle copy**)

Formal institutional methodologies to improve variability:

- Moderation
- External examination


Issues that might be of interest:

- Assessment communities of practice
- Departmental cultures
- Standards often tacit

Nice exercise: given 2 essays and asked to rank. We all pretty much agreed.

**Writing ILOs is a skill**

Now we're talking about marking criteria. Big movement at end of 1990s to develop explicit marking criteria.

We've been handed a bunch of marking criteria.

i. What do you think of them in principle? Could you make use of the idea?

People like the transparency. They have to be good.

ii. What do you think of these specific example? how would you need to adapt them?

iii. Do you use anything like this already? If so, what is it like and how well does it work?

These broadly describe the quality of a piece of work. Specifically designed a mechanism for offering feedback to students.

One sheet asks students to highlight where exactly they would like some feedback.

**As long as you can be clear and give an educated argument about how you're marking then that's fine.**

Assessment criteria has been shown to not improve student performance. Although a marking exercise called "The intervention" was run:

Students were given before the workshop: 3 pieces of past work. The students were asked to evaluate the work and that improved the grades.

Read work from a guy called _Royce Sadler_. He said that students need to mark other work... Very interesting idea...

"Developing student capability in complex appraisal."

## Constructive alignment

**Design** is one possibility of where we go in this module.

We're given a task:

- Individually:

i. Consider one of your courses and its learning outcomes.
ii. Then consider whether the current teaching and assessment methods are consistent with these outcomes. Especially ask yourself, is whether each of the learning outcomes has been achieved really being assessed?

Discussed MAT013 and saying that things are pretty much ok there...

## Purposes of assessment

_Why do we assess students?_

My individual list:

1. Certification;
2. Ensure learning outcomes are met;
3. Obtain feedback as to progress;
4. Tradition;
5. Obtain feedback as to design of a course;

Our group list:

1. Gatekeeper;
2. Gives students targets to aim for;
3. Motivation to achieve it;
4. Classify students;
5. measure skills
6. feedback on learning
7. feedback on teaching
8. learning from students
9. opportunity to apply and perform
10. tradition
11. student expect it

**Read paper by Brown G et al 1997.**

Another list:

1. Motivation
2. Create learning activities
3. Provide feedback
4. Judging performance
5. Quality assurance

1,2,3 are formative and 4 and 5 are summative.

## Formative vs summative assessment.

Formative: focus is to help the student learn;
Summative: focus is to measure how much has been learnt.

Problems of summative assessment:

Can:

- Encourage surface/strategic approaches;
- not value/buil on/make use of prioer learning and experience and student ability;
- encourage playing safe/avoid risk-taking;
- not provide self efficacy;
- be time consuming for staff/reduce overall amount of assessment.

11 conditions under which assessment supports learning 1.
Gibbs and Simpson 20012

1. Sufficient assessed tasks are provided for students to capture sufficient study time.
2. These tasks are engaged with by students;
3. Tackling the assessed task engages students in productive learning
4. Assessment communicate...
5. ...

One important point is that students don't act and or read feedback.

If they don't read it that might be because linkages between modules are not made clear.
If they don't act on it that might be because they don't know how.

**Important** observation: as individuals we work in a constrained environment which is the University.

## Formative assessment - where and when?
(Chickering and Gamson, 1987)

Some recommendations of good feedback practice: Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick 2006.

We spend too much time crafting the perfect feedback (lol), try not to treat feedback as a product. Feedback is a process: a dialogic process NOT A dualogue: a conversation amongst multiple people.

`From Dialogue to Monologue`


## Self assessment

Simple:

- Strengths of this piece of work
- Weaknesses in this piece of work
- How this work would be improved
- The grade it deserves is...
- What I would like your comments on

Complicated: See handout `Psychology PRactical comment sheet`

An important skill but it is also very closely relate to peer assessment.

# Peer marking - Using model answers (Forbes & Spence, 1991)

Peer feedback - Geography (Rust 2001)
Peer feedback - Computing (Zeller, 2000)

# Group work

Group work is important but it's difficult to assess correctly. Institutionally there is a contradiction as we don't graduate groups.

(Johnson, Johnson and Smith 2007)

Now talking about fears that Students have:

- Social loafing (dissapearing in to back of group and do nothing)
- free riding (not only is a student doing nothing but they are getting marks)

He gives a list of possible approaches (Race 2001)

- Simplest path (everyone gets the same mark)
- Divide and concur (assess individual components)
- Add differentials (the whole group shares the total group mark according to their contributions)
- Add contribution marks (as well as group marks a smaller additional, individual, component)
- Add further tasks
- Test orally
- Test in writing

Interesting talk about "grading for effort or grading contributions"... Will need to talk about this in paper.

In guy's experience the Simplest path and add further tasks is most used.

# Statement banks

Write out frequently used feedback comments, for example:

1. I like this sentece/section because it is clear and concise;
2. I found this paragraph/section/essay well organised and easy to follow;
3. I am afraid I am lost. This paragraph/section is unclear and leaves me confused as to what you mean;
4. I would understand and be more convinced if you gave an example/quote/statistic to support this;
5. It would really help if you presented this data in a table.

**Idea of creating immediate feedback exercises/quizzes**

Also idea of assessing a selection (Rust, 2001)

# Group exercise: come up with peer assessement

1. Marks or P/DP/F? (probably go with P/DP/F as 2000 word document allowed for individual work)
2. Distribution of marks? (probably go with simplest path)
3. Quantitative for peer assessment.
4. Q and A?
5. Qualitative feedback and in particular look at feed forward so that we tackle ILO 5.

Other suggestions:

- Was it useful to the audience?
- Engagement of audience including evaluation and feedback
- Catering to diverse learning group
- Content (scholarship of topic)
- Clear, coherent presentation
