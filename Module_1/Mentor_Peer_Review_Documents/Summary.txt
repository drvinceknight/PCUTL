	There are basically 4 "outputs" that we need to "fill in":
		Output 1: VK to fill in lesson plan
		Output 2: This will be filled in with PH review
		Output 3: This is the reflection, so will pull some stuff from PH's report and some new stuff from VK.
		Output 4: I have no idea what boxes are supposed to be ticked by who (I'm happy to just tick as appropriate).
