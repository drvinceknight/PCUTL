Notes from third day (14/9/2012)

**Teaching and learning practice in HE**

Discussion about clothing, how should one dress when teaching? (not too sure what conclusion was)

Brief discussion about yesterday, someone has asked about involving students in learning outcomes. A suggestion has come up: get students to design exams.

Long discussion about feedback.


**Teaching for learning**

An exercise:
Assemble a collection of teaching and learning methods with which you are familiar. Analyse them for their strengths and weaknesses:
	From the students point of view
	From the lecturer's point of view

	No mention of flipped classrooms, or IBL. Decided to keep my mouth shut, too complicated and no one knows about this.

	Came up with list of 10:

	- Lecturing [good for S,L] [bad for ] <- I think this one is bad for students
	- Small group work [good for S,L] [bad for ]
	- Project work [good for S] [bad for ]
	- Workshop/Labs [good for SL] [bad for ]
	- Seminars [good for SL] [bad for ]
	- 1-2-1 [good for SL] [bad for ]
	- Informal  [bad for ]
	- Roleplaying  [bad for ]
	- Discussion [bad for ]
	- SDL [bad for ]
	- Structured debates [bad for ]
	- Group tutorials [bad for ]
	- Reflective learning [bad for ]
	- Peer led [good for S] [bad for ]

We've been given a list of teaching methods. This list is incomplete: doesn't have IBL and/or flipped classrooms.

We briefly mentioned social media. Someone commented on people being rude on forums, doesn't know what social media is... Sigh...

Reason we do these courses: "Help you find the appropriate method that works for you and your course."

We need to understand the best methods for us.





The more we know about our students the better and the more the students think we know about them the better. Anonymity is a dangerous thing in HE.

	*Lecturing

What makes lecturing work effectively:
	Control
	Structure
	Progression
	Breaking up a lecture
		[There's a book called: "What's the use of lecturing"]
		Research has shown that students can't listen to stuff for more than 20 minutes...
	Pauses and recaps
	Build simple structured lecture notes, give them to students in advance and build on them in lectures.
	Summary
		Mine and yours

[Very nice discussion about whether or not absence in lectures is a good thing]

What can be the difficulties with lecturing:

	Being able to get ideas across

Some notes are going to be given out with guys own notes.
Don't tell students important things re course administration at beginning or end of lecture (they're not there).

ADVICE: Don't ever end a lecture with "does anyone have any questions?". No one will want to hold everyone back at end of lecture.
To handle questions, say "is there anything you'd like us to talk about a bit more".

Always discuss what learning outcomes are at beginning of lecture.


	*Using groups
	Good stuff:
Focus
Peer learning
Lecturer involvement
Diminish impact of disruptive students

[Mature students don't like group work. They're automatically given the leadership role.]

We have been given a handout.

ADVICE: "Don't get down with the kids"

	Bad stuff:
Dangers of group dynamics.

Students don't want to be seen as problems. Don't treat them as such.

	*Practicals/demonstrations/studios
	*Tutoring
	*Other

**Managing teaching events**

	*Planning

We're asked to run a 50 minute session. Need to give:
	- Teaching method
	- Outcomes

I have written down 1 for game theory...

Use term "plenary" to describe "return to full group after break up in to groups".

Pedagogic issue of making mistake and learning from mistakes...

ADVICE: Find a subtle way of checking time. Not good for students to see that you're checking the time.

	*Presentation
	*Critique

**Reflection and review for portfolio**

Personal positives:

- Learning outcomes strategies
- Running of teaching - general tips
- Discussion about alternatives to Lecturing
- Planning of teaching
- Know that other lecturers face same difficulties


Assessment:
Mentor Peer review:
	- With students
	- Will need to provide paperwork:
		* Comments on Peer Review
		* Mentor should give something in writing (or could record discussion - perhaps video?)
		* Need to show that you have reflected on peer review:
			- What would you do different
			- What would you address
Mapping against the ukpsf:
	- Tick on grid - Need to show that you are engaging with standards (part of HEA accreditation).
Assessment documentation:
	- Will need to complete the assessment documentation (this is on LC and will maybe be sent to us as well...).
1 annotated lesson plan:
	- Do need to provide a lesson plan
		* Suggest that it it the same lesson that Mentor will see
		* "Annotation" means that we have an explanation of particular methods used.
			- include links to things we have read
		* Also include resources (slides, notes etc...)
		* Mentor comments
		* Reflection
3 Journal entries:
	- 3 suggested titles (they are in folder):
		* 1st 1 is about "UK HE and your role in it"
		* 2nd 1 is about "You and your understanding of you as a teacher"
		* 3rd 1 is about "Lesson planning and engagement with students has changed as a result of reading etc.."
	- In LC you can click a button to get an email to see when someone responds.
	- 500 words
	- Level 7 writing:
		* Critical (key thing)
		* Engaged
		* Higher sophistication level
	- Expected for this module to start your exploratory reading - there is a good list on LC. Most of it is poorly written.
		* Biggs
		* Light and Cox
		* Reference policy (government papers)
		* Has seen pieces of work with 6 references and up to 30.
Covering claim:
	- Piece of work (1000~1500 words) justifying that we've met the learning outcomes.
