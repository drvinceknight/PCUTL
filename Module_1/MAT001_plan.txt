4 days of lectures, scheduled from 0900 to 1700.

Day 1:

Decision Analysis:
	Maxmin etc...
	Decision Trees
	Bayes Theorem
	Utility Theory

(Think about lectures, lab session, games?, sage sheet?, videos?, case study?)

Schedule:
	Before:
		Invite students to revise basic probability
		Invite students to view video on subject (VK to find/make)
		Maybe make short video + sage interact looking at a simply DT with Bayes theorem

	During:
		0-10 mins: Introductory lecture setting out rules and expectations of students:
			Discuss with learning with students
			Expectation for class participation (justified by above)
			Discuss learning outcomes and assessments
			Introduce LS+AF perhaps?
			Show website (explain that for my part of the module, content on LC is not as up to date or reliable as content on my website "don't look at LC for this part of the module")
		10-30 mins: Figure out some sort of group game perhaps? Get students to fill in decisions perhaps?
		30-50 mins: Lecture on decision trees?
		50-60 mins: Break
		60-80 mins: Bayes Theorem group game?
		80-90 mins: Lecture on Bayes Theorem?
		90-100 mins: Example of exercise making use of Bayes Theorem?
		100-110 mins: Break
		110-130 mins: Utility Theory Game?
		130-140 mins: Utility Theory Lecture
		140-180 mins: Utility Theory Lab session (need to check that precision tree still works ok)



	After:
		Tutorial Sheet
		Invite students further reading on DA

Game Theory:
	Normal form games
	Pure Strategies
	Mixed Strategies

Schedule:
	Before:
		Invite students to look at videos:
			EU-EMS Interface
			Introduction to mixed strategies

	During:
		0-20 mins: 2/3rds of average gamte
		20-40 mins: Lecture on Pure Strategies
		40-50 mins: Break?
		50-80 mins: PD tournament

		100-130 mins: Sage lab (2 by 2)?
		130-140 mins: Break
		140-    mins: Tutorial session
	After:
		Invite students to some research papers
		Tutorial Sheets
		Invite students to other videos:
			PD videos
			Mixed strategies videos
			Pigou's example video (VK to make?)

Reliability Theory:
	Reliability
	Collection of components
	Planned replacement

Schedule:
	Before:
		Invite students to read?
		Invite students to look at videos?
			General Integration video
			General Pdf video
	During:
		0-10 mins: Demo of reliability program?
