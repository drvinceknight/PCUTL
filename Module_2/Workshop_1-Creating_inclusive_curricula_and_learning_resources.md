## Disability and Inclusivity: Designing and Delivering an Accessible Curriculum

We've been given handouts.

Session to start with discussion.

(Presenting just said that she's very excited about having a clicker for the first time... Seriously?)

Session today is to think about things that help and hinder learning. Thinking about barriers for particular group of students.

Thinking about social attitudes of students.

We have been given 3 scenarios.

Interesting discussion about the scenarios.

Providing a framework. It's ok to make certain things clear from the outset.

- Treat each other with dignity
- Listen to each other
- Keep discussion on topic and off people
- Do not use inflammatory or offensive language

With regards to groups:

- ensure that the tasks and the expected outcome are clearly defined
- consider whther to allow students to select their own groups or whether to allocate them yourself
- recognise that students may not distribute the groups workload fairly and consider whether to provide additionaly structure to address this.
- structure the task so that grou member have clear roles and responsabilities


Responding to difficult situations:

- Keep calm
- Instant response: "It makes me uncomfortable to hear you saying that."
- Protected characteristics:
    - Disability
    - Sexual Orientation
    - Religion or belief
    - Race
    - Age
    - Sex
    - Pregnancy or Meternity
    - Gender reassignment

Handling students with disabilities:

Address all students at beginning of course:

"I have not been told about any students with disabilities so please let me know."

Describe making adjustments as "going to the gym". Don't make an adjustment that alter academic standards.

Now reading laws to us...

We're now doing case studies on students with disabilities. This is quite tedious...

Talking about Anna (scenario). Discussing cost of having her own tutor: not realistic.

Disabled allowance tutor.

Discussion about giving out notes prior to the lecture. Some people saying that if they gave the notes out before then the students would not turn up. This is all just reaffirming my belief on giving all content to students. Let the students adjust. I feel that it is a bit arrogant to believe that the best way a student learn would be in my lecture. This came up because of talking about giving some material to students to disabled students so that they can prep.

Add to issues of accessibility the fact that I have videos and stuff.
