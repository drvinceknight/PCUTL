##Troublesome Parts

---
all topics were fine - unsure whether or not exam will come as a shock given lecture material is easy 


---
Reliability theory i didn't feel had enough examples, which made the exercise sheet more difficult. There were lots of tricks that didn't seem to be highlighted in the notes.

Queueing theory felt like a big step up in terms of the amount of information we were being given, hence why the class seemed dead by 2:30, if there is a way to split this out a bit more or cut one of the subjects down that would be good. 


---
The inventory theory notes were very long and it felt rushed. 
I would have preferred the lecture notes/lecture to be structured in distinct types of stock models. ie a summary specifying the main differences.  


---
I think this section simply needs more of everything; more explanation, examples and exercises. I've done the exercises and understood, mostly, how we reached the answers, but I couldn't do them without the solutions and have no confidence that I could answer them in the exam. The other topics are really easy and clean cut but this one requires a good working knowledge of mathematical techniques and probability theory, making it all more difficult. 


---
it's a little complecated. 
I think I need more exercise sheet to practice in order to be familar with these theory 


---
These are tougher than the other topics. Altough there is a limit amount of time, maybe some numeric examples in class to understand the formulas would be better.  


---
I struggled with making the decision trees in this topic. 


---
I found queuing theory required more time to go through, as each stage needed in depth algebra, and there wasn't enough time in lectures to fully understand each stage, which made it seem more confusing than other topics. However there was plenty of time and support outside of lectures to go through each example. 


---
The amount of algebra manipulation in queuing theory was a bit overwhelming and it might have been better to spend more time going over it. It probably would have been better to have it all on one day as well, instead of splitting it up over two days. I think some people forgot things with the week in between.

With reliability theory, the main problem was just all the integration. 


---
game theory was the area i was least familiar with (not done before) - I thought the second half of the lecture covered a lot of new concepts quite fast relative to the other subjects. regarding project management this was also a very brief lecture though it is a simpler topic and better explained by practical experience 


---
Not much time was spend on the series-parallel and parallel-series systems on components. 


---
Inventory - I felt that we went too fast over the later harder models and it wasnt clear as to how a lot of the formulae had been obtained
(I think I particularly found it hard as the notation used was quite different to how I had been previously taught by Jeff)

Reliability - Again, I think I just need to get used to the different notation compared to how I have previously been taught 


---
For decision theory, I can't figure out the decision tree correctly before reading the solution. And some integration procedures in inventory theory have been difficult for me. I would like to read more detailed solutions for the exercises. 


---
Just because probability and integration aren't my best/favorite best areas. 


---
Reliability - Isnt clear to me how to tell whether a system is Components in Parallel or Series.

Queuing - I have studied this before so i understood it, but i felt for those who hadn't studied it before as i felt you where very inconsistent with notation (i.e. you didnt make it clear the distinction between a queue and the system so people where struggling to determine what you where talking about) and seemed to struggle explaining this and would try to explain things in diffierent ways but wouldn't really follow through on any one method of explanation.
