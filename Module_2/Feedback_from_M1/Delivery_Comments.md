I felt the lectures were sufficient to understand the concepts, and the exercise sheets sufficient to cement this knowledge. If I had missed lectures, or when I come to revise, I imagine I will find the videos helpful.

promote the G+ page more

As we are not able to use the sage package during the exam i felt spending an hour each week learning it was a waste of my time. I understand that it useful in visualizing problems and checking answers at home but i would have rathered been given the training material needed to do in my own time if i wanted and spent more time doing example questions. 


---
I sometimes feel the content was rushed -areas which were maybe more difficult were skimmed over wheras too much time was sometimes spent on basics.  


---
Really easy to access notes using the website. 


---
they are helpful. 
thanks very much for Dr.Vincent

Notes and solutions take a lot of stuff for granted. They are not have the appropiate detailed data for a student to build on them. Not all of the students come from a mathematical undergraduate or background.  


---
In the solutions to check your own answer to the correct solution it was difficult to find points of mistakes as the solutions had little explanation surrounding them. There were also mistakes making you feel like you lack the understanding or you are doing things wrong leading to frustration. 


---
The videos were helpful as you could go through explanations multiple times at your own pace to fully understand the methods.

I didn't look at the G+ posts because I'm not on G+! 


---
I expected the videos to be a bit shorter, which is why I didn't go back and rewatch them after the lecture.

In regards to Sage, it would have been helpful to have a more extended tutorial (perhaps during induction week) and also to not have to rely on the server in Washington. Since it is able to be downloaded and installed, it should have just been put on all the computers ahead of time. 


---
i did not feel the Sage lab work was especially relevant to the lectures (they did not reinforce the material to be assessed). i believe the 'visualization' aspect was already adequately provided through examples during the lectures 


---
I found the resources and solutions easy to access and read but some what lacking in detail. Some proofs jump from one line to another with assumed knowledge that not all students may have, especially those not from a mathematical background. 


---
- Would have been useful for emails to notify us when new relevant videos had been posted

- Was hard to use Sage outside of tutorials and weren't taught in much detail on how to write the code in Sage other than what was explained in the tutorial sheets

 


---
It was difficult for me to go through the notes before the lectures. More descriptive wordings are needed. I would never feel disturbed if there are too much explainations and I would like to know all of it. 


---
I found the notes particularly hard to read but I guess that was due to my non-mathematical background. Additionally, with time allowing you could perhaps run through a few real life examples, in order to apply the proof to a typical exam style question. 


---
Feel like the questions within some of the examples sheets arent written vary well/clearly, so took a while to figue out what the question was actually asking me top do (not what mathematical method to use but stuggleing with the wording). 

Maybe could have explained a little about the code writing for Sage in the labs sessions, so can then use it to answer/help with other quesions we are set.
