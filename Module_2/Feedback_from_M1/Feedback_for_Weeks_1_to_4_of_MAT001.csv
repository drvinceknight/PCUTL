In regards to Sage, it would have been helpful to have a more extended tutorial (perhaps during induction week) and also to not have to rely on the server in Washington. Since it is able to be downloaded and installed, it should have just been put on all the computers ahead of time.","Reliability Theory, Queueing Theory","The amount of algebra manipulation in queuing theory was a bit overwhelming and it might have been better to spend more time going over it.

- Was hard to use Sage outside of tutorials and weren't taught in much detail on how to write the code in Sage other than what was explained in the tutorial sheets

","Reliability Theory, Inventory Theory","Inventory - I felt that we went too fast over the later harder models and it wasnt clear as to how a lot of the formulae had been obtained
(I think I particularly found it hard as the notation used was quite different to how I had been previously taught by Jeff)

Reliability - Again, I think I just need to get used to the different notation compared to how I have previously been taught","Game Theory, Markov Chains, Queueing Theory, Project Management","Game theory - Had never studied before and found really interesting and well explained. Enjoyed doing the practical session in class

Queueing theory - I liked the fact that we were taught how to set up the equations through markov chains rather than differenatial equations - found this method much easier

","- When explaining things on the board it would be helpful to clear the whole board before writing as can get a bit confusing and messy. It's sometimes hard to tell what is what

- It's good that you go through the first parts quite quickly as they are normally quite straight forward but needs to slow down when explaining the harder stuff towards the end. It sometimes feels quite rushed"

Queuing - I have studied this before so i understood it, but i felt for those who hadn't studied it before as i felt you where very inconsistent with notation (i.e. you didnt make it clear the distinction between a queue and the system so people where struggling to determine what you where talking about) and seemed to struggle explaining this and would try to explain things in diffierent ways but wouldn't really follow through on any one method of explanation.","Inventory Theory, Project Management","Only because both of these i very much enjoyed in previous studies, but i felt both where better explained to me previously. Also your notation in these isnt very helpful; the notation i have used beofre was a lot clearer and and made the whole subject easier to comprehend.","You seemed slightly patronising when explaining things that people asked about, but i did like the fact that you didnt mind people just asking as you went a long, and people felt comfortable enough to ask if they where struggling."
