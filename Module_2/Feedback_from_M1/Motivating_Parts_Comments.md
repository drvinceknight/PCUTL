##Motivating Parts

---
Material and delivery were good. The subject requires a lot of self study in order to keep up  (which is only expected for a Masters level course). The pace was reasonable and the explanation was sufficient.

However, the use of negative questions such as "is there anyone who DOESN'T understand what I just said" MAY be intimidating to some students. 


---
clear lecturer - printed exercise sheets would be great so we can work on examples immediately in problem classes, without having to log on and work at a computer.  


---
Enjoyed the subjects for the most part, thought the lecturing was good, easy to get help from lecturer or PHD students who are all approachable. 


---
I hope we have more exercise sheet regarding to our lecture. 


---
i thought it was delivered reasonably. I don't believe questions asked in class were answered to the detail the questioner intended leaving to people remaining puzzled and lacking the understanding. 


---
Really enjoyed the lectures! 

It was really helpful to have the notes printed out as it made the topics easier to follow. 

The exercise sheets were also very useful, but maybe there could have been more questions given to provide more practise to test understanding further. 


---
pdf lecture notes would be preferable (ppt slides contain many repeats, + smaller font) 


---
The content was generally easy to understand but I'd covered a lot of the material before and if I'd have been starting with these subjects new I would have found the delivery too fast. 


---
- When explaining things on the board it would be helpful to clear the whole board before writing as can get a bit confusing and messy. It's sometimes hard to tell what is what

- It's good that you go through the first parts quite quickly as they are normally quite straight forward but needs to slow down when explaining the harder stuff towards the end. It sometimes feels quite rushed 


---
Like I wrote before, more detailed notes, exercises solutions and explainations in lectures are needed for me. They also minimise the number of questions I will have. 


---
Generally enjoyed the lectures adn where you could, made it fun and relevant.  


---
You seemed slightly patronising when explaining things that people asked about, but i did like the fact that you didnt mind people just asking as you went a long, and people felt comfortable enough to ask if they where struggling.
