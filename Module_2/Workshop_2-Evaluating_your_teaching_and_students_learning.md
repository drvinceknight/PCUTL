#Evaluating your teaching and students learning

Kate Exley is an independant consultant. Genetisist by background.

Schedule: aim to finish around 1500~1515.

Talking about evaluation:

- Evaluate our own practice and our own programs
- "Is our teaching having the effect we want on our learners?"

We will be asked to do some design. We will also do a critique of a range of methods.

In pm will look at 3 methods:

- Critical review 
- Focus groups
- Peer review


##Context:

We will be required to evaluate teaching and performance (yearly cycle).

Who evaluates teachings:

- The teacher
- The students
- The mentors
- Heads of schools
- Internal auditors
- Professional bodies
- External quality reviewers etc...

##Evaluation

Lol, first thing discussed is Kolb...

- Plan
- Do
- Review
- Put in context

Kolb:

> 'Knowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and transforming it'


- Reflection in action
- Reflection on action
- Reflection for action

David Nicol (2010) talks about feedback to students. Importance of making feedback a 2 way dialog.

She's now asking us to design a test measure to check if "the learning outcome is happening in class".

*Got feedback from Andy suggesting I perhaps use some sort of class exercise in pm that would make sure students are able to carry out computations. I feel that concepts are being well evaluated through the in class exercises.*

##Evaluation method
Feedback can be looked at from 2 points of view:

- Teacher:
    - Teacher performance
    - Module review
    - Personal development

- Learner:
    -Learning experience
    -Value added
    -Achieve learning outcomes

We have listed a bunch of methods:

- PRLT
- End of year forms
- mid term feedback
- self review (video)
- prof. accreditation
- results of assessment
- in class exercise
- informal discussion with students
- the buzz in the room
- questions from students
- brain storming

Others have mentioned:

- staff student panels
    - benefits: can get a response
    - Can be percieved as a complaints forum

- Peer review:
    - specific
    - personal
    - informal
    - enables continuous and evolving practice
    - Can be a very negative experience based on the reviewer

- Engagement:
    - intangible
    - immediate
    - hard to record, document and measure. `We can use these things in portfolio.`

- Questionnaires, feedback forms:
    - Anonymous

Other stuff:

- Post-it notes
- The 'muddiest point': `Could you write down the one thing that you'd like me to recap next time`
- One minute papers
- Use of handsets/clickers - to test learning.

Note of caution with regards to immediate feedback. `What do you do if you get immediate feedback showing that students don't understand things half way through a lecture.`

##3 approaches in close up

- Teacher's perspective
- Student's perspective
- Didn't have time to write it down

###1 Teacher - Reflective accounts

Some pointers on reflecive writing for people not coming from that background:

- Reaction
    - Affective domain (illustrative examples), what happened and why?
- Reflection
    - Cognitive domain (meaning of evidence), how is is relevant to me and my students?
- Responsability
    - Psychomotor domain (so what), so what?

3 paragraphs?

- what did I do?
- why did I do that?
- What happened?
- What did I think/feel?
- Why that that happen?
- What influenced it?
- Who thought that?
- Why did they think that?
- What would improve it?
- Why did that work well?

We're asked to think about a critical incident. I'm going to talk about the time that a coalition formed during an outreach event.

###2 Student - Focus Groups

Talking about what a focus group is.

- How would you select students?
- What questions would you ask?
- How would run the session?
- How would you record the data?
- How would you analyse findings?

###3 Peer review

- Briefing
- Observation/engagement
- De-briefing
- Generating, Using and Documenting evidence?

How it happens:

- Who?
    - Discussion about expertise
    - Discussion about seniority
- What?
    - Any teaching (online materials?)
- How?
    - to do it well takes 2~3 hours.
- What documentation should be kept?
    - "sign off"
    - Documentation (clarify timing of feedback)

Process of peer review should be seperate from other processes in university. 4 principles:

- Confidentiality in feedback
- Separate to other University processes
- Emphasis on Development not Judgemenet
- Involement of all teachers

#Tips for portfolio

- Talk about technology (we're having a talk by Steve Rutherford)
- Talk about inclusion

#Closing the feedback loop

> It is couterproductive to ask students for information then not use it; students become cynical and uncooperative if they think no one really cares about what they think.

> It is important to ensure that actions takes place on the basis of students biews and that action is seen to take place.

How can we achieve this...

- Personally
- Departmentally

CARBS do this, poster in the halls saying `this is what you said, this is what we've done`.
Sometimes saying `yes I've heard your feedback and won't do that because of x,y,z...`
