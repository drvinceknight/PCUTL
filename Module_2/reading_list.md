Neat paper that present evidence for the flipped classroom approach on a cohort of 200 odd students.

On the teaching methodology: `The emphasis was very much on participatory discussion with the class, rather than instructor presentation to the class. `

Great evidence against giving out notes in advance:

> An often-heard comment relating to provision of material to students (usually lecture notes) in advance of class sessions is “If you give them the lecture notes, they might not or won't turn up". We gave students not just lecture notes, but in effect the entire course content in advance of class sessions: it might reasonably be asked did we not have empty lecture theatres by week 5? In fact, we did not see any evidence of a significant decline in lecture attendance 1 , which we were able to “measure” by observing a relatively constant number of total clicker votes per question (across 140 individual clicker question episodes) as function of a time period spanning 11 weeks of the course. There was a slight decline towards the final week of teaching in the semester, perhaps partly explained by the effects of a long teaching semester taking its toll and the looming shadow of degree examinations 2 weeks after the course concludes. This teaching methodology, therefore, provides evidence against the "no notes in advance" argument as a technique to maintain student attendance and engagement.

Feedback was collected showing that students preferred this teaching approach (see plots in paper).

> Perhaps more significant than the additional workload is the mental shift that is required to accept and embrace an unstructured, contingent lecture experience in which the lecturer is no longer in complete control of.

#### *Approaches to Learning: A Guide for Educators (Have purchased)*

This book is awesome. The first chapter on the Philosophy of education is very interesting indeed discussing the three philosophical ideas of education:

##### Chapter 1: Philosophy of Education

- Idealism
- Experience
- Development

*Idealism is concerned (suprise surpise) with Ideads.** With concepts such as Socratic dialog an emphasis is placed on logic and a questioning of conceptions. In it's essence this is well suited to Mathematics (although whether or not ideas relating to the encouraging of discussion of interpretation of ideas is relevant is an interesting question...). Another nice quote on the subject of Idealism is the following:

> In the Socratic dialogues, Socrates gives the example of the slave boy who had no knowledge of geometry but was able to understand a theorem drawn in some way, and was 'remembering it'.

Idealism has 3 main implications for teaching:

1. an emphasis on theory before practice;
2. an emphasis on logical thinking;
3. a high value attached to liberal education.

The book outlines various education implications for each of the above. Such as the fact that emphasising theory before practice would emphasise general principles over particular examples (I wonder if this is in line with some of the questions asked by Bret Benesh in his blog post on assessement) and that a liberal education would value education for its own sake.

**The second major educational philosophy is Experience.** This notion is opposed to Idealism in that it states that experience is more significant than theory. There are two strands in this category:

1. Empiricism
2. Romanticism

The first claims that students are passive recipients of experience (through the senses). This implies a very high value to a Teacher (to ensure that students go recieve the required experiences). The second is opposed to this and assumes that students should not be put in structured environments and left to learn from their experiences naturally.

The ideas of Empicism are closely related to the Behaviouralist ideas of Pavlov (which are more closely looked at in Chapter 2 of the book). One of the most important educational implications of this thought process in my opinion is that learning is a science and has general principles (I'm not sure whether or not this is something that sits comfortably with me, I need to think about it).

Romanticism was widely developed by Rousseau in the 18th Century according to whom:

> humans are naturally good but corrupted by civilization.

The experiences that will contribute to the education of a student should arise naturally:

> if the child breaks a window, they should suffer the consequences of the cold wind that will rush through.

The implications of romanticism include that the purpose of education is the development of the whole person and that all learners are different (this is inherently apposed to the 'the learner will respond to learning stimuli in a predicatble way' of the empiricsm idea).

**The final idea considered is Development.** This makes a teacher analagous to a gardener aiming to grow a plant 'to it's full potential'.

The corresponding philosophy is 'Teleology' which is closely linked to ideas of Aristotle (plants grow, animals, grow and feel, humans, grow feel and think). Unlike the ideas of empiricism which places teachers at the center of the learning experience, this places students at the center of the learning experience.

Various implications are presented including that students must know why they are learning a topic and that they are motivated by boalds.

**This chapter is well written and give a nice introduction to the philosophical ideas of education. The chapter ends highliting the importance of the philosophy of education for educaters.**

##### Chapter 2 Behaviourism

> "Behaviourism is the most influential and generalizable theory of learning that claims a scientific basis."

This chapter goes over various aspects of behavourism:

- Ideas of classical conditioning (train a dog to salivate when ringing a bell);
- Reinforcement;
- Generalization;
- Drives;

> "The classical behaviourist view has the stimulus leading directly to the response. In comparison, between the stimulus and response, Hull interposes the organism whose drive and habit strength vary, so that the response depends not only on the stimulus but also on the characteristics of the intervening organism.

The above ideas are described as Neo-behaviourist (adding in ideas of Skinner which allow for students to self re-inforce and self monitor).

**The above two ideas make me think of the flipped classroom in a MOOC sense as a behaviouralist idea.** External stimuli: videos. Response: tests and quizzes. Indeed this is akin to the "machines" of Skinner: [skinner1958b].

Blooms taxonomy is also mentioned here. In the 1950s Bloom attempted to build a model that linked external and internal behaviour. Note that [refernce] contains a Blooms taxonomy mapped to mathematics.

The positive and negative aspects of Behaviourism are presented, it is an efficient pedagogy in promoting rapid learning although it does not promote deep learning (with my experience of MOOCS I can relate to this). Behaviourism also has many negative connotations related to 'power and control and has connotations of animal training'.

**Behaviourism is a deterministic theory: the subject has no choice but to respond to appropriate stimuli.**

Moocs attempt to stay away from this through their encouragement of the use of social networks...

##### Chapter 3 Cognitivism

The move from behaviourism to Cognitivism is nicely explained in a single sentence:

> "The structural linguist Naom Chomsky challenged this by arguing that stimulus-response does not explain how children can generate sentences they have not heard before."

Cognitivism treats students as computers. It assumes that learning is the individual application of a mental process.

Cognitivism places education in a technico-rational setting (recall the empiricism philosophy of education). As such it ignores the individualisation of learning by students. Due to the scientific basis cognitivism gives to education it does offer various valuable implications:

- Importance of using a varied presentation of information in terms of sensory mode;
- The importance of context for learning;
- Importance of promoting active listening in lectures and/or presentations.


##### Chapter 4 Construcivism

Constructivism builds on cognitivism by understanding not just how a student 'perceives' information but also how a student gives the information their own 'meaning'.

There are various 'schools of thought' in constructivism:

- 'Trivial constructivism': teachers must not interfere with the individual process of reconfiguring perceived information.
- 'Social constructivism': teachers should act as a support for the learners thinking. This takes place in the **Zone of Proximal Development**. Main big thinker of this was Vygotsky.
- 'Critical constructivism': learners should construct 'meaning' of information by questioning 'hierarchy'. This in essence aims to place teachers as peers.

I particularly like the ideas of Vygotsky. As an implication to education the idea of Scaffolding appears which acts as a support which aims to help learners construct new knowledge.

> 'Scaffolding may consist of resources, challenging activities and mentoring provided by teachers or more experienced peers.'

I believe that sentence places me quote well in the Vygotsky school of thought.

##### Chapter 17 The Future

> "If knowledge can be accessed in a multiplicity of ways, then learners will choose teachers for their ability to engage, both with the knowledge and the learning. It will require a different set of aptitudes from the teacher, requirin artistry rather than a set of technical skills."
> "Teachers will have a role in motivating learners through personal coaching, and in scaffolding support learners in their personal projects. Teachers will be freed from knowledge transmission or duplication, to act as critical friends and guides for learners.

###IBL/Student lead

####*When good teaching leads to bad results: The disasters of well taugher Mathematics courses*

This paper discusses a case study on a particular mathematics course:

    - It was a succes based on `classical` critera
    - It was a failure according to threshold concepts

In early research the subject was seen as a minor variable to teaching (see Doyle 1978). Furthermore:

> Learning was operationally defined as performance on achievement tests -- tests which, as we shal see below, may fail in significant ways to measure subject matter understanding.

More recent work (Brown and Burton 1978, Helms and Novak 1985, Romberg and Carpenter (1985)) show the importance of subject specific teaching methodologies.

> In elementary arithmetic, for example, Brown and Burton (1978) developed a diagnostic test that could predict, about 50% of the time, the incorrect answers that a particular student would obtain to a subtraction problem -- before they student worked the problem.

Awesome quote:

> The predominant model of current instruction is based on waht Romber and Carpenter (1985) cakk the absorption theory of learning. 'The traditional clasroom focuses on competition, management and group aptitudes; the mathematics taught is assumed to be a fixed body of knowledge, and it is taught under the assumption that learners absorb what has been covered'. According to this view the good teacher is the one who has ten different ways to say the same thing; the student is sure to 'get it' sooner or later. However the misonceptions literature indicates that the students may well have 'gotten' something else --  and that what the student as gotten may be resistant to change.
