#Todo

1. Read literature
2. Write covering claim `That student is taught the best who is told the least.`:
    - Use data to explain use of IBL/flipped classroom hybrid approach (Still need to analyse data) **Analysis of data will do for now, still need to read literature**
    - Discuss potential Shadow Modules (might use this in y1 programming module)
    - Discuss inclusivity (go to town on references and be happy..., perhaps mention how no students mentioned issues... in feedback exercise?)
3. Do peer review with Nikkos, plan to do soon, possibly do overlooking entire R course lesson plans (lessons plans almost written, I need to write a reflection on them).
4. Response to M1 feedback

#Done

1. Have uploaded M1 lesson plan
2. Have pointed towards resources on discussion board
