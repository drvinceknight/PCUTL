Stephen Rutherford will talk about supporting learning in non contact time (he basically uses a flipped classroom model).

## Models and perspectives of learning

1. Four orientations to learning
2. Learning outcomes and ways of thinking and practising
3. Threshold concepts
4. Perry's cognitive theory of student development
5. Biggs' constructive alignment

Looking at handout, 4 aspects:

- Behaviourist:
    - Skinner would `re-introduce corporal punishment in higher ed`.
    - Also a bunch of praise.
    - This is akin to parenting.
    - The main skinnerian process for teaching in higher ed is assessement. `I will not learn this unless I'm tested on it`.
- Cognitivist: 
    - Need to help students build up a context and framework and help them study for themsleves.
- Humanist:
    - Rogers is the main dude.
    - Notion of educating the whole person.
    - If you're still in your last year wholy dependant on the evaluation of your teachers: you should fail.
- Social and situational.
    - Lave and Wenger are the main dudes.
    - Learn in groups, learn in relationships. 
    - This model is currently a `hot topic`. 

Problem based learning is a good example of the Social and Situational model. 

We've been handed a document titled: `Learning outcomes and Ways of Thinking across Contrasting Disciplines and Settings in Higher Education.`

This url is worth looking at: [the etl website](http://www.ed.ac.uk/etl).
*Entwistle is worth reading.*, lots of papers on the etl website.

Lots of talk about the models.

We have been passed another document `An introduction to threshold concepts`. This looks interesting.

Threshold concepts have come out of the etl project, so basically go take a look at that bibliohgraphy. The above document given to us a summary of the work of Eric Meyer and Grey Lave.

Discussing how mathematicians: thereshold concept `understanding proofs`, as opposed to manipulating number...

Asked what the difference between ILOs and Threshold concepts. ILOs are for the degree, Threshold concepts are about becoming a mathematician...

Very nice comment: `Understanding threshold concepts is a threshold concept`.

Discussion about fact that as Lecturers we must not forget what it is like to `not get it`.

#Supporting learning in contact and non contact learning time.

Stephen Rutherford talks about using videos I think. Steve did PCUTL 7 years ago.

Aim is to encourage students to interact with each other and the lecturer.

Interested in information delivery. `Where is the lecture?` (Who is the lecturer?)

Impressed: he knows about Youtube, Kahn Academy etc...

> Technology should support practice and not drive it.

3 approaches:

- Large group teaching
- Small group activity/student lead teaching
- Feedback

> Dead against a lecture having a learning outcome. Not a learning activity but an engagement activity.

Lecture alternatives:

- Student given lectures
- Student directed lectures (use clickers to let students have some control)
- Pre recorded lectures

Law record all lectures after lecture.

Steve is now telling us how to record lectures. He uses Camtasia.

Relevant to Student given lectures, student directed lectures:
Classical theorist of teaching: Vygotsky and the ZPD:
*Zone of Proximal Development*

Showing one of the group activities they ran. Getting students to design learning resources. One group did a lego stop motion thing.

Discussion about interactivity:

- Wanted students to have more input...

Idea of shadow modules. Very cool.

Mentioning:

- Gdocs
- Wikis
- Prezi
- Study Blue (not very user friendly)

Shadow module. Shadow module. Shadow module. Great idea.

Discussing how facebook worked really well. Need to create a `fake account`.


*Use technology to support teaching/learning. NOT FOR ITS OWN SAKE.*

#Symposium session

Talking about dissability, inclusion, LGBT.

## LGBT Classroom Inclusion
_Erich Hou, Law School_
Starts off with a short story to discretely point out his sexuality. Was this important?

Going to talk about difficulties related to talking about sex in the classroom.

Particular law he's talking about is `The Equality Act 2010`.

Equality and diversity:

- Rule 1: Treat like cases alike.
- Rule 2: Treat different cases differently.

Being shown about a video. 

- Female vicar, used to be a man.

He used the video to talk about a subject he didn't want to address. This talk is about how to talk about sex in the classroom. Not very relevant, I don't ever talk about sex. One point has been raised which is to use neutral terms: `Gender`.

*Someone raised an excellent point which is that sexuality could arise everywhere, not just the classroom.*

Also discussing heteronormativity. I.e. assuming that `normal` is `heterosexuality`.

## Supporting Learning in the International Classroom
_F S Sartorio CPlan_

She's talking about the international classroom. How to handle students who don't know what's going on.

Principles:

1. Clarity
2. Assumptions
3. Expectations
4. Repetition
5. Interest
6. Transformation
7. Values
8. Environment

Lookup international student lifecycle on [heacademy website](http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/international-student-lifecycle).

[Teekens](http://inclusive-teaching.wikispaces.com/file/view/Teekens'+Profile.pdf)

## Universal design for non disability focused challenges to learning. Assumptions about digital literacy in learning... and teaching.

Talking about embeding awareness in staff development.

He has briefly mentioned `assumptions about access that students have to software`.

Context + Opportunity + Choice

Talking about using facebook and limitation (need an account). Be sure to talk about this with regards to G+: no need for an account.


We're now having a panel discussion.


#Bringing it all to a close: summary of M2

Drawing day to a close.

Submission deadline: 20nd of February.
(Beginning of M3: 8th and 9th of April.)

Word limit: 
    - Anticipated word limit is: 2500 words.
    - But recognize that you are likely to overun. Perhaps reflections on peer review, work with mentor can be put in mentor.
    - Screen capture of online interaction does't count to word count.

*Need to show that we're engaging in academic literature.*
We want to talk about inclusivity (lots of literature), and also TEE.

M1 lesson plan will go on discussion board (add in comments about inclusivity).
Other lesson plan can be used on peer review. 
Also need to start a conversation:
    - MOOCS
    - Open education resources
    - Open software (access by students)
    - *Ted x flipped classroom maker*
    - google course creato...

Summary of stuff:

1. Completed summative assessement forms, including self assessement and reflection.
2. Completed UKPSF grid. Complete M2 and inclue M1.
3. Completed form from mentor to show that you have spoken to them. 
4. Covering claim (counts to word limit - can put pedagogys in here, but some people put that stuff in the M2 lesson plan)
5. 2 Lessons plans including annotations and reflective thoughts.
6. Evidence of discussion boards (lol, I'll use their LC one and go to town on G+ posts). Examples of communication and contribution.
7. Response to feedback from M1.
8. Document and show how you're are going to take forward development points.
9. Peer review and response. (Two sets of paper work: the paper work you give to your peer and the paper work they give you).

*2500 words will be in 4,5,6,8 and 9.*

Need to hit 1,3,4 LO with dp to get dp for block.
