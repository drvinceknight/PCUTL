# Books and Papers I'd have liked to review

This is the 8th post in my blog series reviewing a bunch of education literature. If they're of interest here are the previous posts in the series:

In this post I won't be reviewing any particular piece of literature. In fact this post will be the last one in this series as I've run out of time and momentum. I spent the past week working like crazy on my [pcutl](http://www.vincent-knight.com/home/teaching/pcutl) portfolio and so I didn't have the time to blog about some of the texts I've read through.

In this post I'll simply list some literature that I'd have like to blog about if I had the time.

## Books/Dissertations

1. ["The effects of the classroom flip on the learning environment: a comparison of learning activity in a traditional classroom and a flip classroom that used an intelligent tutoring system" by Strayer](http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=osu1189523914)

That is just a small selection of papers and books, I'm sure I'm missing out a bunch of excellent ones that were pointed out to me on G+ and elsewhere.

I thought I'd also include a section on Blogs. There are some awesome bloggers around that post some great stuff about education, I most certainly will forget a bunch of great ones but here they are (where possible I've also linked to their G+ profile, that's probably where I met them).

There's also a bunch of great resources that Dana Ernst put together that I'd recommend taking a look at [here](http://danaernst.com/resources/).

**Conclusion**

I've enjoyed reviewing papers and blogging about them. I might well continue to do so. If it's of interest the post in the series that got the most reads is [my review of a paper offering evidence for a flipped classroom](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/a-review-of-paper-offering-evidence-for.html).

In all the post of this series I gave a mark out of 10 to each paper as far as usefulness to my PCUTL portfolio is concerned. Without a doubt the most useful piece of literature is ["Approaches to Learning: A Guide for Teachers" by Jordan et al.](http://goo.gl/HtpeH). I really recommend that book: it's great.
