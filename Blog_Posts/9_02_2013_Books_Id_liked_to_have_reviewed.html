<p>In this post I won't be reviewing any particular piece of literature. In fact this post will be the last one in this series as I've run out of time and momentum. I spent the past week working like crazy on my <a href="http://www.vincent-knight.com/home/teaching/pcutl">pcutl</a> portfolio and so I didn't have the time to blog about some of the texts I've read through.</p>
<p>In this post I'll simply list some literature that I'd have like to blog about if I had the time.</p>

<p>That is just a small selection of papers and books, I'm sure I'm missing out a bunch of excellent ones that were pointed out to me on G+ and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I thought I'd also include a section on Blogs. There are some awesome bloggers around that post some great stuff about education, I most certainly will forget a bunch of great ones but here they are (where possible I've also linked to their G+ profile, that's probably where I met them).</p>

<p>There's also a bunch of great resources that Dana Ernst put together that I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="http://danaernst.com/resources/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I've enjoyed reviewing papers and blogging about them. I might well continue to do so. If it's of interest the post in the series that got the most reads is <a href="http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/a-review-of-paper-offering-evidence-for.html">my review of a paper offering evidence for a flipped classroom</a>.</p>
<p>In all the post of this series I gave a mark out of 10 to each paper as far as usefulness to my PCUTL portfolio is concerned. Without a doubt the most useful piece of literature is <a href="http://goo.gl/HtpeH">&quot;Approaches to Learning: A Guide for Teachers&quot; by Jordan et al.</a>. I really recommend that book: it's great.</p>
