<p>This is the 6th post in my blog series reviewing a bunch of education literature. The other posts can be found here:</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://goo.gl/HtpeH">fourth post</a> in my series I described briefly some of the learning models presented in &quot;Approaches to Learning: A Guide for Teachers&quot;. One of the pedagogic models very well described in that book is Behaviouralism, and one important contribution to Behaviouralism is Bloom's taxonomy.</p>
<p>Bloom's taxonomy is a model that attempts to link external and internal behaviour (a feature lacking in classical Behaviouralism which only considered external stimuli as having an effect on learning). What bloom did was put together various levels of learning. Here's the Cognitive skills:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Knowledge</li>
<li>Comprehension</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Synthesis</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>This document by Shorser (passed on to my by +paul harper) maps the above <em>general</em> taxonomy to <em>mathematics</em>.</p>
<p>The document first of all lists the above levels, describing them. It then goes on to list some keywords for evaluating each of them. For example: Knowledge - &quot;List&quot; and Evaluation - &quot;Rank&quot;.</p>
<p>The final part of the document gives some examples of questions for each level of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This is a handy little document to have if only to use as a cheat sheet (so to speak) when setting exam questions and evaluating students learning.</p>
<p>Here's my &quot;PCUTL Mark&quot; out of 10 which I'm using to say how useful this piece of literature is to me in the scheme of my pcutl portfolio (so it's not meant as a reflection of the quality of the paper which is subjective):</p>
<p>PCUTL Mark: 5 (Not extremely useful for PCUTL but a great reference document)</p>
