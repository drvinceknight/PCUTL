<h2 id="a-quick-start-guide-to-the-moore-method-by-mahavier-et-al.">A Quick-Start Guide to the Moore Method by Mahavier et al.</h2>
<p>This is the second post in my series aiming to review a bunch of education literature. The previous post reviewed a paper looking at how threshold concepts could be missed when teaching a &quot;classicaly&quot; well run course.</p>
<p>This post is about a short paper aiming to introduce the reader to the Moore Method or Inquiry Based Learning (IBL).</p>
<p>My personal introduction to IBL was through G+ and +Dana Ernst (who kindly passed this paper on to me) and +Theron Hitchman.</p>
<p>This paper does not offer a very long description as to what IBL is or how to teach with it but it does give some pointers towards how to get started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'The majority of a Moore-method mathematics course will consist of students' presentations of solutions they produce independently from material provided by the instructor'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite educational quotes (which I'm in fact using as the header for my second module <a href="">pcutl</a> portfolio) is by Moore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'That student is taught the best who is told the least.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a brief introduction of the Moore method the paper goes on to the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Should I use the Moore Method?&quot;</strong> (highlighting that every teacher should use what is best suited to their personality)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;I want to try the Moore Method. How do I start?&quot;</strong> (options include attending workshops and/or looking up a mentor)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;How do I develop or select materials?&quot;</strong> (there are a bunch of materials already developed, but pointers are also given for people wanting/needing to develop their own)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;What are the student goals for a Moore Method course?&quot;</strong> (3 student centred goals are offered as starting points)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;How do I gain the support of my department chair and colleagues?&quot;</strong> (A short discussion is offered that I won't try to fit in to these brackets, but basically it's worth getting support...)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;What will I do in the classroom each day?&quot;</strong> (Some tips are given as to how to facilitate a pseudo-socratic discussion and ensure that students are ready to present. Most importantly it's highlighted that the teacher should not be the center of attention.)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;How do I grade a Moore Method course?&quot;</strong> (A nice quote out of this section is &quot;whatever grading system you decide on, it should encourage 'learning' over 'earning'&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>&quot;How do I assess my Moore Method courses?&quot;</strong> (Lots of nice examples: requiring students to keep a diary, saving examples of students work and others...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> This is a nice paper with a bunch of references, pointers to resources and a good overall discussion about how to implement an IBL approach in class.</p>
<p>Here's my &quot;PCUTL Mark&quot; out of 10 which I'm using to say how using this piece of literature is to me in the scheme of my pcutl portfolio:</p>
<p>PCUTL Mark: 6 (this might be a bit low but it's not as useful as the previous paper)</p>
